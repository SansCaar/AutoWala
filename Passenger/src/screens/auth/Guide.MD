# Routes

_The guide shows how the auth works and also inclueds the routes with the output and input data to the route_

> The server url or the domain in the local host is http://10.0.2.2:3001 at least for me:

```serverUrl = "http://10.0.2.2:3001"
```

## Routes.

```get serverUrl/v1/api/user/
> This will return all the users from the database.
```
